#'William's \%R
#'
#'William's \% R.
#'
#'If an High-Low-Close series is provided, the indicator is calculated using
#'the high/low values.  If a vector is provided, the calculation only uses that
#'series.
#'
#'@param HLC Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
#'High-Low-Close prices.  If only a univariate series is given, it will be
#'used.  See details.
#'@param n Number of periods to use.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HLC} or a vector (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the William's \%R values.
#'@note The William's \%R calculation is similar to stochastics' fast \%K.
#'
#'The value for William's \%R will be 0.5 whenever the highest high and
#'lowest low are the same over the last \code{n} periods.
