\title{ Chaikin Money Flow }
\description{
  Chaikin Money Flow compares total volume over the last \code{n} time periods to total volume
  times the Close Location Value (CLV) over the last \code{n} time periods.  Developed by Marc
  Chaikin.
}
\usage{
  CMF(HLC, volume, n = 20)
}
\arguments{
  \item{HLC}{ Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains High-Low-Close prices. }
  \item{volume}{ Vector or matrix of volume observations corresponding to the \code{HLC} object. }
  \item{n}{ Number of periods to use. }
}
\details{
  Chaikin Money Flow is calculated by taking dividing the sum of the Chaikin Accumulation /
  Distribution line over the past \code{n} periods by the sum of volume over the past
  \code{n} periods.
}
\value{
  A vector containing the Chaikin Money Flow values.
