\title{ Bollinger Bands }
\description{
  Bollinger Bands are a way to compare a security's volatility and price levels over
  a period of time.  Developed by John Bollinger.
}
\usage{
  bollingerBands(HLC, ma=list("SMA", n=20), sd=2)
}
\arguments{
  \item{HLC}{ High-Low-Close price series to use.  If only a univariate series is given,
    it will be used.  See details. }
  \item{ma}{ A \emph{list} whose first component is a string containing the moving average
    function name; additional parameters may also be specified as \emph{named} components. }
  \item{sd}{ The number of standard deviations to use. }
}
\details{
  Bollinger Bands consist of three lines:

  The middle band is generally a 20-period SMA of the typical price ([high + low + close]/3).
  The upper and lower bands are \code{sd} standard deviations (generally 2) above and
  below the MA.

  The middle band is usually calculated using the typical price, but if a univariate series
  (e.g. Close, Weighted Close, Median Price, etc.) is provided, it will be used instead.
}
\value{
  A matrix containing the columns:
  \item{ dn }{ The lower Bollinger Band. }
  \item{ ma }{ The middle Moving Average (see notes). }
  \item{ up }{ The upper Bollinger Band. }
  \item{ pctB }{ The \%B calculation. }

\note{
  Using any moving average other than SMA will result in inconsistencies between the
  moving average calculation and the standard deviation calculation.  Since, by
  definition, a rolling standard deviation uses a simple moving average.

\examples{
  ## The examples below show the differences between using a
  ## High-Low-Close series, and just a close series when
  ## calculating Bollinger Bands.

  bbands.HLC <- bollingerBands( ttrc[,c("High","Low","Close")] )
  bbands.close <- bollingerBands( ttrc[,"Close"] )
