TTR version 0.13-2
  Changes from version 0.13-1

- Aligned function argument syntax so there were no spaces around equal signs.
  E.g. function(x, ma = list("EMA", n=9)) -> function(x, ma=list("EMA", n=9))

- Updated WebData.Rd, changes.Rd, and ttrc.Rd to use \code{'foo'} instead of
  \code{\sQuote{foo}}.

- Renamed TTR-package.Rd to TTR.Rd

- Renamed ttr.tools.Rd to TTRtools.Rd and ttr.tools.R to TTRtools.R

- Renamed Oscillators.R to oscillator.R

- Renamed Oscillators.Rd to oscillator.Rd and combined MACD and oscillator
  portions of the \value{} section.

- Changed EVWMA so period n contains the value for periods (i-n+1):n and 
  so periods 1:(n-2) will be NA.

- Changed EMA so periods 1:n will be NA.

- Changed order of oscillator() arguments from 'ma.slow, ma.fast, ma.sig' to
  the traditional 'ma.fast, ma.slow, ma.sig'.  Thanks goes to Jeff Ryan.

- The arguments to the chaikinOscillator function were changed as above.
