\description{
  Donchian Channels were created by Richard Donchian and were used to
  generate buy and sell signals for the Turtle Trading system.
}
\usage{
  DonchianChannel(HL, n=10, include.lag=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{HL}{ Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains High-Low prices. }
  \item{n}{ Number of periods for moving average. }
  \item{include.lag}{ Should values be lagged so that today's prices are
    not included in the calculation? }
}
\details{
  Donchian Channels consist of two (sometimes three) lines:

  The top line is the highest high of the past \code{n} periods.
  The bottom line is the lowest low of the past \code{n} periods.
  The middle line is the average of the top and bottom lines.
}
\value{
  A object of the same class as \code{HL} or a matrix (if \code{try.xts}
  fails) containing the columns:
  \item{ high }{ The highest high series. }
  \item{ mid }{ The average of \code{high} and \code{low}. }
  \item{ low }{ The lowest low series. }
