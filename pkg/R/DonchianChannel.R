#'Donchian Channel
#'
#'Donchian Channels were created by Richard Donchian and were used to generate
#'buy and sell signals for the Turtle Trading system.
#'
#'Donchian Channels consist of two (sometimes three) lines:
#'
#'The top line is the highest high of the past \code{n} periods.  The bottom
#'line is the lowest low of the past \code{n} periods.  The middle line is the
#'average of the top and bottom lines.
#'
#'@aliases DonchianChannel Donchian
#'@param HL Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains High-Low
#'prices.
#'@param n Number of periods for moving average.
#'@param include.lag Should values be lagged so that today's prices are not
#'included in the calculation? See Note.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HL} or a matrix (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{ high }{ The highest high series. }
#'   \item{ mid }{ The average of \code{high} and \code{low}. }
#'   \item{ low }{ The lowest low series. }
#' }
#'@note The default of \code{include.lag=FALSE} makes \code{DonchainChannel}
#'consistent with other \pkg{TTR} functions, in that it includes the current
#'period in the calculation.
#'
#'The default is different than the original calculation, which would calculate
#'the indicator using periods t-1 through t-n. Setting \code{include.lag=TRUE}
#'will return the result of the original calculation.
#'
#'The default of this argument may change in the future.

  # Notes from John Bollinger:
  #
  # "In the old paper-calculation days you would calculate the numbers
  #  after the close by hand and for use in the next day's trading to gauge
  #  the "n-day" breakouts and you would have used n-days worth of data the
  #  calc. Thus an n-day calc with a lag of one would be consistent with
  #  practice in Donchian's day. (Total window of n+1.) Another example are
  #  the floor traders numbers or pivots, which are calculated from the
  #  prior period's data for use on the current period. In both case
  #  including the current period in the calculation would not be correct."
