#'Arms' Ease of Movement Value
#'
#'Arms' Ease of Movement Value (EMV) emphasizes days where the security moves
#'easily and minimizes days where the security does not move easily.  Developed
#'by Richard W. Arms, Jr.
#'
#'The EMV is calculated by dividing the midpoint ([high + low]/2) move by the
#''Box Ratio' (volume divided by the high minus low).
#'
#'@param HL Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains High-Low
#'prices.
#'@param volume Vector or matrix of volume observations corresponding to the
#'\code{HL} object.
#'@param n Number of periods for moving average.
#'@param maType A function or a string naming the function to be called.
#'@param vol.divisor An increment to make the results larger and easier to work
#'with.
#'@param \dots Other arguments to be passed to the \code{maType} function.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HL} and \code{volume} or a matrix
#'(if \code{try.xts} fails) containing the columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{ emv }{ The ease of movement values. }
#'   \item{ emvMA }{ The smoothed (as specified by \code{ma}) ease of movement values. }
#' }
#'@note A buy/sell signal is generated when the EMV crosses above/below zero.
#'When the EMV hovers around zero, there are small price movements and/or high
#'volume, and the price is not moving easily.

#'options; and note Warning section.
