OPEN WISHES:

- Better handling of multiple moving average formals than current
  maType=list() implementation.

- Functionality to summarize results of technical trading rules.
  (via PerformanceAnalytics?)


GRANTED WISHES:

- Ability to handle and return other class structures (e.g. zoo, ts).
  GRANTED: 'xts' does all this, and more!

- A plotting function that allows charting price, volume, indicators,
  etc. on one device.
  GRANTED: quantmod provides an excellent solution.
