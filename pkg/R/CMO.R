#'Chande Momentum Oscillator
#'
#'The Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) is a modified RSI.  Developed by Tushar
#'S. Chande.
#'
#'The CMO divides the total movement by the net movement ([up - down] / [up +
#'down]), where RSI divides the upward movement by the net movement (up / [up +
#'down]).
#'
#'@param x Price, volume, etc. series that is coercible to xts or matrix.
#'@param n Number of periods to use.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{x} or a vector (if \code{try.xts}
#'fails) containing Chande Momentum Oscillator values.
#'@note There are several ways to interpret the CMO:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Values over/under +/- 50 indicate overbought/oversold conditions.
#'   \item High CMO values indicate strong trends.
#'   \item When the CMO crosses above/below a moving average of the CMO,
#'         it is a buy/sell signal.
