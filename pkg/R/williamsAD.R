#'Williams Accumulation / Distribution
#'
#'The Williams Accumulation / Distribution (AD) line is a measure of market
#'momentum.  Developed by Larry Williams.
#'
#'The Williams AD line differs from OBV and chaikinAD in that it doesn't take
#'volume into account.
#'
#'@param HLC Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
#'High-Low-Close prices.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HLC} or a vector (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the accumulation / distribution values.
#'@note The Accumulation/Distribution Line is interpreted by looking for a
#'divergence in the direction of the indicator relative to price.
#'@author Joshua Ulrich
#'@seealso See \code{\link{OBV}}, \code{\link{chaikinAD}}, and
#'\code{\link{ATR}}.
