#'Chaikin Accumulation / Distribution
#'
#'The Chaikin Accumulation / Distribution (AD) line is a measure of the money
#'flowing into or out of a security.  It is similar to On Balance Volume (OBV).
#'Developed by Marc Chaikin.
#'
#'The AD line is similar to OBV; the difference is that OBV sums volume
#'multiplied by +/- 1 if the close is higher/lower than the previous close,
#'while the AD line multiplies volume by the close location value (CLV).
#'
#'@param HLC Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
#'High-Low-Close prices.
#'@param volume Vector or matrix of volume observations corresponding to the
#'\code{HLC} object.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HLC} and \code{volume} or a
#'vector (if \code{try.xts} fails) containing the accumulation / distribution
#'values.
#'@note The Accumulation/Distribution Line is interpreted by looking for a
#'divergence in the direction of the indicator relative to price.
