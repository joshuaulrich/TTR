#'De-Trended Price Oscillator
#'
#'The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) removes the trend in prices - or other
#'series - by subtracting a moving average of the price from the price.
#'
#'The Detrended Price shows cycles and overbought / oversold conditions. Note
#'the calculation shifts the results \code{shift} periods, so the last
#'\code{shift} periods will be zero.
#'
#'@param x Price, volume, etc. series that is coercible to xts or matrix.
#'@param n Number of periods for moving average.
#'@param maType A function or a string naming the function to be called.
#'@param shift The number of periods to shift the moving average.
#'@param percent logical; if \code{TRUE}, the percentage difference between the
#'slow and fast moving averages is returned, otherwise the difference between
#'the respective averages is returned.
#'@param \dots Other arguments to be passed to the \code{maType} function.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{x} or a vector (if \code{try.xts}
#'fails) containing the DPO values.
#'@note As stated above, the DPO can be used on any univariate series, not just
#'price.

#'@seealso See \code{\link{EMA}}, \code{\link{SMA}}, etc. for moving average
#'options; and note Warning section.  See \code{\link{MACD}} for a general
#'oscillator.
