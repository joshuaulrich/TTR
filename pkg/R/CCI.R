#'Commodity Channel Index
#'
#'The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) attempts to identify starting and ending
#'trends.
#'
#'CCI relates the current price and the average of price over \code{n} periods.
#'The CCI usually falls in a channel of -100 to 100. A basic CCI trading system
#'is: Buy (sell) if CCI rises above 100 (falls below -100) and sell (buy) when
#'it falls below 100 (rises above -100).
#'
#'CCI is usually calculated using the typical price, but if a univariate series
#'(e.g. Close, Weighted Close, Median Price, etc.) is provided, it will be used
#'instead.
#'
#'@param HLC Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
#'High-Low-Close prices.  If only a univariate series is given, it will be
#'used.  See details.
#'@param n Number of periods for moving average.
#'@param maType A function or a string naming the function to be called.
#'@param c Constant to apply to the mean deviation.
#'@param \dots Other arguments to be passed to the \code{maType} function.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HLC} or a vector (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the CCI values.
#'@note If \code{HLC} is a High-Low-Close matrix, then typical price will be
#'calculated.  If \code{HLC} is a vector, then those values will be used
#'instead of the typical price.
#'@author Joshua Ulrich
#'@seealso See \code{\link{EMA}}, \code{\link{SMA}}, etc. for moving average
#'options; and note Warning section.  See \code{\link{aroon}},
#'\code{\link{ADX}}, \code{\link{TDI}}, \code{\link{VHF}}, \code{\link{GMMA}}
#'for other indicators that measure trend direction/strength.
