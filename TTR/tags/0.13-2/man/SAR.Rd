\description{
  The Parabolic Stop-and-Reverse calculates a trailing stop.  Developed by J. Welles Wilder.
}
\usage{
  SAR(HL, accel=c(0.02, 0.2))
}
\arguments{
  \item{HL}{ Object able to be coerced to a matrix, which contains High-Low prices. }
  \item{accel}{ accel[1]: Acceleration factor.\craccel[2]: Maximum acceleration factor. }
}
\details{
  The calculation for the SAR is quite complex.  See the URLs in the references section
  for calculation notes.

  The SAR assumes that you are always in the market, and calculates the Stop And Reverse
  point when you would close a long position and open a short position or vice versa.
