\usage{
  MACD(x, nFast = 12, nSlow = 26, nSig = 9, maType,
    percent = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{Object that is coercible to xts or matrix;
  usually price, but can be volume, etc.}

  \item{nFast}{Number of periods for fast moving average.}

  \item{nSlow}{Number of periods for slow moving average.}

  \item{nSig}{Number of periods for signal moving average.}

  \item{maType}{Either: \enumerate{ \item A function or a
  string naming the function to be called.  \item A
  \emph{list} with the first component like (1) above, and
  additional parameters specified as \emph{named}
  components.  See Examples. }}

  \item{percent}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the percentage
  difference between the fast and slow moving averages is
  returned, otherwise the difference between the respective
  averages is returned.}

  \item{\dots}{Other arguments to be passed to the
  \code{maType} function in case (1) above.}
}
\value{
  A object of the same class as \code{x} or a matrix (if
  \code{try.xts} fails) containing the columns: \describe{
  \item{ macd }{ The price (volume, etc.) oscillator. }
  \item{ signal }{ The oscillator signal line (a moving
  average of the oscillator). } }
}
\description{
  The MACD was developed by Gerald Appel and is probably
  the most popular price oscillator.  The MACD function
  documented in this page compares a fast moving average
  (MA) of a series with a slow MA of the same series.  It
  can be used as a generic oscillator for any univariate
  series, not only price.
}
\details{
  The MACD function either subtracts the fast MA from the
  slow MA, or finds the rate of change between the fast MA
  and the slow MA.
}
\note{
  The MACD is a special case of the general oscillator
  applied to price. The MACD can be used as a general
  oscillator applied to any series. Time periods for the
  MACD are often given as 26 and 12, but the function
  originally used exponential constants of 0.075 and 0.15,
  which are closer to 25.6667 and 12.3333 periods.

macd  <- MACD( ttrc[,"Close"], 12, 26, 9, maType="EMA" )
macd2 <- MACD( ttrc[,"Close"], 12, 26, 9,
         maType=list(list(SMA), list(EMA, wilder=TRUE), list(SMA)) )
