TTR version 0.20-2
  Changes from version 0.20-1


NEW FEATURES:

- Added VWAP and VWMA (thanks to Brian Peterson)

- Added v-factor generalization to DEMA (thanks to John Gavin)


CHANGES:

- Updated volatility() to handle univariate case of calc='close'
  (thanks to Cedrick Johnson)

- Moved EMA, SAR, and wilderSum from .Fortran to .Call and used
  xts:::naCheck in lieu of TTR's NA check mechanism

- RSI up/down momentum now faster with xts (thanks to Jeff Ryan)

- If 'ratio' is specified in EMA but 'n' is missing, the traditional
  value of 'n' is approximated and returned as the first non-NA value


BUG FIXES:

- Fix to stoch() when maType is a list and 'n' is not set in the list's
  3rd element (thanks to Wind Me)

- Fixed fastK in stoch() when smooth != 1

- Fixed segfault caused by EMA when n < NROW(x) (thanks to Douglas Hobbs)

- test.EMA.wilder failed under R-devel (thanks to Prof Brian Ripley)
