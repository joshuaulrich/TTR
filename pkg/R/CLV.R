#'Close Location Value
#'
#'The Close Location Value (CLV) relates the day's close to its trading range.
#'
#'The CLV will fall in a range of -1 to +1.  If the CLV is +/-1, the close is
#'at the high/low; if the CLV is 0, the close is directly between the high and
#'low.
#'
#'@param HLC Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
#'High-Low-Close prices.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HLC} or a vector (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the Close Location Values of a
#'High-Low-Close price series.
#'@author Joshua Ulrich
#'@seealso See \code{\link{chaikinAD}}, which uses CLV.
