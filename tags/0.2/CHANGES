TTR version 0.2
  Changes from version 0.14-0


NEW FEATURES:

- Added the zig zag indicator: ZigZag()

- Added volatility estimators/indicators: volatility(), with
  the following calculations
  - Close-to-Close
  - Garman Klass
  - Parkinson
  - Rogers Satchell

- Added Money Flow Index: MFI()

- Added Donchian channel: DonchianChannel()


CHANGES:

- All functions now use xts internally, adding support for all major
  time series classes.  If try.xts() fails on the input object(s),
  they will be converted to a matrix and a matrix object will be
  returned.

- Added 'bounded' arg to stoch() and SMI(), which includes the current
  period in the calculation.

- Added naCheck() and implemented it in the moving average functions.

- Moved maType argument default values from function formals to
  function body for the following functions:
    ADX, ATR, CCI, DPO, EMV, KST, MACD, RSI, TRIX, BBands,
    chaikinVolatility, stoch, SMI

- momentum() in CMO() no longer sets na=100

- Replaced 'na' argument in momentum() and ROC() with 'na.pad'

- Added 'multiple' argument to TDI(), allowing more user control

- getYahooData() now returns an xts object

- Added colnames to output for ADX, EMV, and CLV (for xts)

- Added unit tests using the RUnit package
  - Used checkEquals on object attributes as well as values

- Removed .First.lib function and added .onLoad with package version.



- Removed all DOS EOL characters via 'vim +"argdo set ff=unix" +wqa *'


BUG FIXES:

- Corrected NaN replacement in CLV()

- Corrected williamsAD(): AD=0 if C(t)=C(t-1)

- Corrected runMedian() and runMAD().  The argument controlling
  which type of median to calculate for even-numbered samples
  wasn't being passed to the Fortran routine.

- aroon() calculation starts at period n+1, instead of n

- Added NA to first element of closeLag of ATR()

- Corrected BBands() and CCI() for rowMeans use on xts objects

- Made changes to Rd files to pass R CMD check on R-devel (2.9.0)
