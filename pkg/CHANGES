SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  - CCI now returns an object with colnames ("cci").

  - All moving average functions now attempt to set colnames.

  - Added clarification on the displaced nature of DPO.

  - SAR now sets the initial gap based on the standard deviation of the
    high-low range instead of hard-coding it at 0.01.


NEW FEATURES

  - Added rollSFM function that calculates alpha, beta, and R-squared for a
    single-factor model, thanks to James Toll for the prototype.

  - Added runPercentRank function, thanks to Charlie Friedemann.

  - Moved slowest portion of aroon() to C.

  - DonchianChannel gains an 'include.lag=FALSE' argument, which includes the
    current period's data in the calculation. Setting it to TRUE replicates
    the original calculation. Thanks to Garrett See and John Bollinger.

  - The Stochastic Oscillator and Williams' %R now return 0.5 (instead of NaN)
    when a securities' price doesn't change over a sufficient period.

  - All moving average functions gain '...'.

  - Users can now change alpha in Yang Zhang volatility calculation.


BUG FIXES

  - Fixed MACD when maType is a list. Now mavg.slow=maType[[2]] and
    mavg.fast=maType[[1]], as users expected based on the order of the nFast
    and nSlow arguments. Thanks to Phani Nukala and Jonathan Roy.

  - Fixed bug in lags function, thanks to Michael Weylandt.

  - Corrected error in Yang Zhang volatility calculation, thanks to several
    people for identifying this error.

  - Correction to SAR extreme point calculations, thanks to Vamsi Galigutta.

  - adjRatios now ensures all inputs are univariate, thanks to Garrett See.

  - EMA and EVWMA now ensure n < number of non-NA values, thanks to Roger Bos.

  - Fix to BBands docs, thanks to Evelyn Mitchell.

BUG FIXES

  - Changed wilderSum to seed initial value with raw sum. This matches
    Wilder's original calculations. Thanks to Mahesh Bp for the report.

  - The BBands sd calculation now uses the population instead of sample
    statistic. This is consistent with Bollinger Band literature. Thanks to
    Jeff Ryan for the patch.

  - Fixed stockSymbols for nasdaq.com changes.

  - Fixed ZLEMA default ratio by changing it from 2/(n-1) to 2/(n+1). This
    makes it consistent with EMA. Thanks to Dirk Eddelbuettel.

  - Corrected close-to-close volatility. Thanks to James Toll for the report.

  - adjRatios failed (spectacularly) if there were missing close prices.
    Thanks to Garrett See for the report.

    xts:::naCheck in lieu of TTR's NA check mechanism.

  - RSI up/down momentum now faster with xts, thanks to Jeff Ryan.

  - If 'ratio' is specified in EMA but 'n' is missing, the traditional
    value of 'n' is approximated and returned as the first non-NA value.

    3rd element, thanks to Wind Me.

    converted to a matrix and a matrix object will be returned.

  - Added 'bounded' arg to stoch() and SMI(), which includes the current
    period in the calculation.

  - Added the zig zag indicator: ZigZag().

  - Added volatility estimators/indicators: volatility(), with the following
    calculations:

    in 'chaikinVolatility.R'

  - Made the following changes to the 'ZLEMA' function:
     - Add ratio argument with default = NULL
     - Non-integer lags are a weighted mean of the two nearest
       observations, based on thier proximity to the lag value
     - Change 'lag = ratio^(-1)' to fully support 'ratio' argument

    length if either series had leading NAs (similar to EVWMA function).

  - Corrected EVWMA to start at period 'n' instead of 'n-1'.
