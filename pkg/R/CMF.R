#'Chaikin Money Flow
#'
#'Chaikin Money Flow compares total volume over the last \code{n} time periods
#'to total volume times the Close Location Value (CLV) over the last \code{n}
#'time periods.  Developed by Marc Chaikin.
#'
#'Chaikin Money Flow is calculated by taking dividing the sum of the Chaikin
#'Accumulation / Distribution line over the past \code{n} periods by the sum of
#'volume over the past \code{n} periods.
#'
#'@param HLC Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
#'High-Low-Close prices.
#'@param volume Vector or matrix of volume observations corresponding to the
#'\code{HLC} object.
#'@param n Number of periods to use.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HLC} and \code{volume} or a
#'vector (if \code{try.xts} fails) containing the Chaikin Money Flow values.
#'@note When Chaikin Money Flow is above/below +/- 0.25 it is a bullish/bearish
#'signal.  If Chaikin Money Flow remains below zero while the price is rising,
#'it indicates a probable reversal.
