TTR version 0.20-0
  Changes from version 0.2-1


NEW FEATURES:

- adjRatios() creates split and/or dividend adjustment ratio
  series via C code.

- GMMA() calculates the Guppy Multiple Moving Average

- volatility() now has Yang Zhang, and Garman-Klass (Yang Zhang)
  calculations.

- The functions below now have cumulative argument.  This allows the
  calculation of "from inception" running series.
    - runSum, runMin, runMax
    - runMean, runMedian
    - runCov, runCor, runVar, runSD, runMAD

- Added internal smoothing to FastK in stoch() via 'smooth' argument
  (thanks to Stanley Neo).


CHANGES:

- Removed message from .onLoad()

- getYahooData() now uses adjRatios(), which yields significant
  improvements for larger data sets.


BUG FIXES:

- Fixed version number; 0.20-0 is now > 0.14-0 (rookie mistake)

- Fixed bug when maType was a list and 'n' was not specified in maType.
  This affected: stoch(), SMI(), RSI(), KST(), MACD(), TRIX().
