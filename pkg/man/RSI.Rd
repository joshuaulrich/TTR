\usage{
  RSI(price, n = 14, maType, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{price}{Price series that is coercible to xts or
  matrix.}

  \item{n}{Number of periods for moving averages.}

  \item{maType}{Either: \enumerate{ \item A function or a
  string naming the function to be called.  \item A
  \emph{list} with the first component like (1) above, and
  additional parameters specified as \emph{named}
  components.  See Examples. }}

  \item{\dots}{Other arguments to be passed to the
  \code{maType} function in case (1) above.}
}
\value{
  A object of the same class as \code{price} or a vector
  (if \code{try.xts} fails) containing the RSI values.
}
\description{
  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculates a ratio of
  the recent upward price movements to the absolute price
  movement.  Developed by J. Welles Wilder.
}
\details{
  The RSI calculation is \code{RSI = 100 - 100 / ( 1 + RS
  )}, where \code{RS} is the smoothed ratio of 'average'
  gains over 'average' losses.  The 'averages' aren't true
  averages, since they're divided by the value of \code{n}
  and not the number of periods in which there are
  gains/losses.
}
\note{
  The RSI is usually interpreted as an overbought/oversold
  (over 70 / below 30) indicator.  Divergence with price
  may also be useful.  For example, if price is making new
  highs/lows, but RSI is not, it could indicate a reversal.

  You can calculate a stochastic RSI by using the function
  \code{\link{stoch}} on RSI values.

\examples{
data(ttrc)
price <- ttrc[,"Close"]

# Default case
rsi <- RSI(price)

# Case of one 'maType' for both MAs
rsiMA1 <- RSI(price, n=14, maType="WMA", wts=ttrc[,"Volume"])

# Case of two different 'maType's for both MAs
rsiMA2 <- RSI(price, n=14, maType=list(maUp=list(EMA,ratio=1/5),
             maDown=list(WMA,wts=1:10)))
