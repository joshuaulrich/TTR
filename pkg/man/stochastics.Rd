\title{ Stochastic Oscillator / Stochastic Momentum Index }
\description{
  The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that relates the location of each day's
  close relative to the high/low range over the past \code{n} periods.  Developed by George C.
  Lane in the late 1950s.  The SMI relates the close to the midpoint of the high/low range.
  Developed by William Blau in 1993.

\usage{
  stoch(HLC, nFastK=14, nFastD=3, nSlowD=3, maType="SMA", \dots)

  SMI(HLC, n=13, nFast=2, nSlow=25, nSig=9, maType="EMA", \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{HLC}{ High-Low-Close price series to use.  If only a univariate series is given,
    it will be used.  See details. }
  \item{n}{ Number of periods to use. }
  \item{nFastK}{ Number of periods for fast \%K (i.e. the number of past periods to use). }
  \item{nFastD}{ Number of periods for fast \%D (i.e. the number smoothing periods to apply
    to fast \%K). }
  \item{nSlowD}{ Number of periods for slow \%D (i.e. the number smoothing periods to apply
    to fast \%D). }
  % What are the correct terms to describe these arguments???
  \item{nFast}{ Number of periods for initial smoothing. }
  \item{nSlow}{ Number of periods for double smoothing. }
  \item{nSig}{ Number of periods for signal line. }
  \item{maType}{ Either: \cr(1) A function or a string naming the function to be called, or\cr
    (2) a \emph{list} with the first component like (1) above, and additional parameters
    specified as \emph{named} components.  See Examples. }
  \item{\dots}{ Other arguments to be passed to the \code{maType} function in case (1) above. }
}
\details{
  If a High-Low-Close series is provided, the indicator is calculated using the high/low
  values.  If a vector is provided, the calculation only uses that series.  This allows
  stochastics to be calculated for: (1) series that have no HLC definition (e.g. foreign
  exchange), and (2) stochastic indicators (e.g. stochastic RSI - see examples).

\note{ 
  The calculation for William's \%R is similar to that of stochastics' fast \%K.

  The stochastic oscillator and SMI calculate relative value of the close versus the high/low
  range and the midpoint of the high/low range, respectively.
  
  The stochastic oscillator and the stochastic momentum index are interpreted similarly.
  Readings below 20 (above 80) are considered oversold (overbought).  However, readings below 20
  (above 80) are not necessarily bearish (bullish).  Lane believed some of the best sell (buy)
  signals occurred when the oscillator moved from overbought (oversold) back below 80 (above 20).

  For the stochastic oscillator, buy (sell) signals can also be given when \%K crosses above
  (below) \%D.  Crossover signals are quite frequent however, which may result in whipsaws.
