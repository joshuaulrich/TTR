\title{ Chaikin Accumulation / Distribution }
\description{
  The Chaikin Accumulation / Distribution (AD) line is a measure of the money flowing into or
  out of a security.  It is similar to On Balance Volume (OBV).  Developed by Marc Chaikin.
}
\usage{
  chaikinAD(HLC, volume)
}
\arguments{
  \item{HLC}{ Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains High-Low-Close prices. }
  \item{volume}{ Vector or matrix of volume observations corresponding to the \code{HLC} object. }
}
\details{
  The AD line is similar to OBV; the difference is that OBV sums volume multiplied by +/- 1
  if the close is higher/lower than the previous close, while the AD line multiplies volume
  by the close location value (CLV).
}
\value{
  A object of the same class as \code{HLC} and \code{volume} or a vector
  (if \code{try.xts} fails) containing the accumulation / distribution values.
