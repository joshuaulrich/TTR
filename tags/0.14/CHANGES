TTR version 0.14-0
  Changes from version 0.13-2


New Features:

- Changed MA-type args and updated documentation for: RSIm ADX, ATR,
  CCI, DPO, EMV, RSI, BBands, chaikinVolatility, stoch, SMI, TRIX,
  MACD, and KST

- Added Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) and williamsAD functions
  and documentation

- Added Fortran implementations of SMA, EMA, WMA, EVWMA, ZLEMA, PSAR

- Added NA checking/handling for many functions

- Added 'ratio' argument to EMA with default=NULL

- Changed all usage of 'rollFun' to their respective Fortran
  implementations and removed the 'rollFun' function.  Added Fortran
  based functions are: runSum, wilderSum, runMin, runMax, runMean,
  runCov, runCor, runVar, runSD, runMedian, runMAD


Changes:

- Changed 'CCI' to use 'runMAD'

- Set 'na=NA' for 'momentum' and 'ROC' functions in files KST.R,
  RSI.R, and TDI.R, and changed 'ROC' to use 'type="discrete"'
  in 'chaikinVolatility.R'

- Changed default 'type' of 'ROC' to 'continuous'

- Made the following changes to the 'ZLEMA' function:
   - Add ratio argument with default = NULL
   - Non-integer lags are a weighted mean of the two nearest
     observations, based on thier proximity to the lag value
   - Change 'lag = ratio^(-1)' to fully support 'ratio' argument

- Changed the 'BBands' function's 'sd' argument from a list
  that allows other dispersion functions to simply indicate the
  number of standard deviations to use

- Changed 'BBands' %B output value from 'pct.b' to 'pctB'

- Changed 'WPR' output value from 'pct.R' to 'pctR'

- Changed 'WPR' MA output value from 'ma.emv' to 'emvMA'

- Changed 'aroon' output values from 'aroon.xx' to 'aroonXx'

- Renamed:
    'chaikinMF' to 'CMF'
    'stochastic' to 'stoch'
    'bollingerBands' to 'BBands'

- Added NAMESPACE 

- Added copyright information at the top of each file (.R and .f)

- Removed all DOS EOL characters via 'vim +"argdo set ff=unix" +wqa *'


Deprecated/Defunct:

- Removed 'oscillator' function and transferred functionality
  to 'MACD' function

- Removed chaikinOscillator, since it can be created via
  MACD( chaikinAD )


Bug Fixes:

- match.arg(type) in ROC changed to simple subsetting of type

- Changed trailing zeros to trailing NAs in DPO

- Fixed 'WMA' bug that allowed 'x' and 'wts' vectors to have different
  length if either series had leading NAs (similar to EVWMA function)

- Fixed 'runCov' bug that allowed 'x' and 'y' vectors to have different
  length if either series had leading NAs (similar to EVWMA function)

- Corrected EVWMA to start at period 'n' instead of 'n-1'

- Removed 'message' function from CCI.R, VHF.R, WPR.R, aroon.R
  bollingerBands.R, and stochastics.R

- Change \sQuote{x} to 'x' in documentation

- Changed documentation so "Usage", "Examples" section are a max of
  ~65-70 characters wide; it now prints better in plain text help

- Updated "detail" section of 'MovingAverages.Rd' via enclosing
  function names in "\code{}" brackets

- Changed "title" section of 'WPR.Rd' to remove unnecessary "\"

- Removed "detail" section from 'runFun.Rd' and replaced "\code{}"
  brackets in "value" section with "\item{}" brackets

- Changed "site(s)" to "sites" in "references" section of "TTR.Rd",
  and included "runFun" in list of interesting functions
