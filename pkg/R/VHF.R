#'Vertical Horizontal Filter
#'
#'The Vertical Horizontal Filter (VHF) attempts to identify starting and ending
#'trends.  Developed by Adam White.
#'
#'The VHF is calculated by subtracting the \code{n}-period lowest low from the
#'\code{n}-period highest high and dividing that result by the \code{n}-period
#'rolling sum of the close price changes.
#'
#'@param price Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains a Close
#'price series, or a High-Low-Close price series.
#'@param n Number of periods to use.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{price} or a vector (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the VHF values.
#'@note If Close prices are given, the function calculates the max/min using
#'only those prices (the default).  If HLC prices are given, the function
#'calculates the max/min using the high/low prices (added for flexibility).
#'@author Joshua Ulrich

#'\code{\link{TDI}}, \code{\link{GMMA}} for other indicators that measure trend
#'direction/strength.
