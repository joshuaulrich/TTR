#'Parabolic Stop-and-Reverse
#'
#'The Parabolic Stop-and-Reverse calculates a trailing stop.  Developed by J.
#'Welles Wilder.
#'
#'The calculation for the SAR is quite complex.  See the URLs in the references
#'section for calculation notes.
#'
#'The SAR assumes that you are always in the market, and calculates the Stop
#'And Reverse point when you would close a long position and open a short
#'position or vice versa.
#'
#'@param HL Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains High-Low
#'prices.
#'@param accel accel[1]: Acceleration factor.\cr accel[2]: Maximum acceleration
#'factor.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HL} or a vector (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the Parabolic Stop and Reverse values.
#'@author Joshua Ulrich
#'@seealso See \code{\link{ATR}} and \code{\link{ADX}}, which were also
#'developed by Welles Wilder.

  # WISHLIST:
  # Determine signal based on DM+/DM- for first bar
  # If sig[1]==1, then ep[1]==high; if sig[1]==-1, then ep[1]==low
  # The first SAR value should be the opposite (high/low) of ep
  # The first acceleration factor is based on the first signal

  # Since I've already lost one bar, do what TA-lib does and use that bar to
  # determine the inital signal value.  Also try to incorporate different
  # accel factors for long/short.
  # accel = c( long = c( 0.02, 0.2 ), short = long )

  # Leading NAs are handled in the C code

  # Call C routine
  sar <- .Call("sar", HL[,1], HL[,2], accel, PACKAGE = "TTR")
