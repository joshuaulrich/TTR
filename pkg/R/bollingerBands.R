#'Bollinger Bands
#'
#'Bollinger Bands are a way to compare a security's volatility and price levels
#'over a period of time.  Developed by John Bollinger.
#'
#'Bollinger Bands consist of three lines:
#'
#'The middle band is generally a 20-period SMA of the typical price ([high +
#'low + close]/3).  The upper and lower bands are \code{sd} standard deviations
#'(generally 2) above and below the MA.
#'
#'The middle band is usually calculated using the typical price, but if a
#'univariate series (e.g. Close, Weighted Close, Median Price, etc.) is
#'provided, it will be used instead.
#'
#'@aliases bollingerBands BBands
#'@param HLC Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
#'High-Low-Close prices.  If only a univariate series is given, it will be
#'used.  See details.
#'@param n Number of periods for moving average.
#'@param maType A function or a string naming the function to be called.
#'@param sd The number of standard deviations to use.
#'@param \dots Other arguments to be passed to the \code{maType} function.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HLC} or a matrix (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the columns:
#' \describe{
#'  \item{ dn }{ The lower Bollinger Band. }
#'  \item{ mavg }{ The middle Moving Average (see notes). }
#'  \item{ up }{ The upper Bollinger Band. }
#'  \item{ pctB }{ The \%B calculation. }
#' }            
#'@note Using any moving average other than SMA will result in inconsistencies
#'between the moving average calculation and the standard deviation
#'calculation.  Since, by definition, a rolling standard deviation uses a
#'simple moving average.
