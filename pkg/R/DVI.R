#'DV Intermediate Oscillator
#'
#'The DV Intermediate oscillator (DVI) is a very smooth momentum oscillator
#'that can also be used as a trend indicator.  Created by David Varadi.
#'
#'The DVI combines smoothed returns over different time windows and the
#'relative number of up versus down days (stretch) over different time windows.
#'
#'@param price Price series that is coercible to xts or matrix.
#'@param n Number of periods for the percent rank.
#'@param wts The weight given to the smoothed returns (magnitude) component and
#'the up/down days (stretch) component, respectively.
#'@param smooth The number of periods to smooth price.
#'@param magnitude A set of 3 periods used to smooth magnitude.
#'@param stretch A set of 3 periods used to smooth stretch.
#'@param exact.multiplier The weight applied to identical values in the window.
#'See \code{runPercentRank}.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{price} or a vector (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the DVI values.
