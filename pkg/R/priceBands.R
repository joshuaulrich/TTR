#'Construct (optionally further smoothed and centered ) volatility bands around
#'prices
#'
#'John Bollinger's famous adaptive volatility bands most often use the typical
#'price of an HLC series, or may be calculated on a univariate price series
#'(see \code{\link{BBands}}.
#'
#'This function applies a second moving average denoted by \code{fastn} to
#'filter out higher-frequency noise, making the bands somewhat more stable to
#'temporary fluctuations and spikes.
#'
#'If \code{centered} is \code{TRUE}, the function also further smoothes and
#'centers the bands around a centerline adjusted to remove this higher
#'frequency noise.  If \code{lavg} is also \code{TRUE}, the smoothing applied
#'for the middle band (but not the volatility bands) is doubled to further
#'smooth the price-response function.
#'
#'If you have multiple different price series in \code{prices}, and want to use
#'this function, call this functions using \code{lapply(prices,PBands)}.
#'
#'@aliases PBands priceBands
#'@param prices A univariate series of prices.
#'@param n Number of periods to average over.
#'@param maType A function or a string naming the function to be called.
#'@param sd The number of standard deviations to use.
#'@param \dots any other pass-thru parameters, usually for function named by
#'\code{maType}.
#'@param fastn Number of periods to use for smoothing higher-frequency 'noise'.
#'@param centered Whether to center the bands around a series adjusted for high
#'frequency noise, default \code{FALSE}.
#'@param lavg Whether to use a longer \code{(n*2)} smoothing period for
#'centering, default \code{FALSE}.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{prices} or a matrix (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the columns:
#' \describe{
#'     \item{ dn }{ The lower price volatility Band. }
#'     \item{ center }{ The smoothed centerline (see details). }
