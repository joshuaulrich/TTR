In no particular order:

- I can't thank Jeff Ryan enough for all his help with TTR via:
  motivation to submit TTR to CRAN, helpful comments, testing, and
  providing an example Fortran implementation of 'EMA' (from which
  all other included Fortran functions are based).

- Many thanks to Ion Georgiadis for helpful suggestions and testing.
