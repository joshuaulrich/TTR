#'Money Flow Index
#'
#'The MFI is a ratio of positive and negative money flow over time.
#'
#'Money Flow (MF) is the product of price and volume.  Positive/negative MF
#'occur when today's price is higher/lower than yesterday's price.  The MFI is
#'calculated by dividing positive MF by negative MF for the past \code{n}
#'periods.  It is then scaled between 0 and 100.
#'
#'MFI is usually calculated using the typical price, but if a univariate series
#'(e.g. Close, Weighted Close, Median Price, etc.) is provided, it will be used
#'instead.
#'
#'@aliases MFI moneyFlow
#'@param HLC Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
#'High-Low-Close prices.  If only a univariate series is given, it will be
#'used.  See details.
#'@param volume Vector or matrix of volume observations corresponding to
#'\code{HLC} object.
#'@param n Number of periods to use.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HLC} and \code{volume} or a
#'vector (if \code{try.xts} fails) containing the MFI values.
#'@note Divergence between MFI and price can be indicative of a reversal.  In
#'addition, values above/below 80/20 indicate market tops/bottoms.
