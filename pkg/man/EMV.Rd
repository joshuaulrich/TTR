\title{ Arms' Ease of Movement Value }
\description{
  Arms' Ease of Movement Value (EMV) emphasizes days where the security moves
  easily and minimizes days where the security does not move easily.  Developed
  by Richard W. Arms, Jr.
}
\usage{
  EMV(HL, volume, ma=list("SMA", n=9), vol.divisor=10000)
}
\arguments{
  \item{HL}{ Object able to be coerced to a matrix, which contains a High-Low price series. }
  \item{volume}{ Vector or matrix of volume observations corresponding to the \code{HL} object. }
  \item{ma}{ A \emph{list} whose first component is a string containing the moving average function
    name; additional parameters may also be specified as \emph{named} components. }
  \item{vol.divisor}{ An increment to make the results larger and easier to work with. }
}
\details{
  The EMV is calculated by dividing the midpoint ([high + low]/2) move by the
  'Box Ratio' (volume divided by the high minus low).
}
\value{
  A matrix containing the columns:
  \item{ emv }{ The ease of movement values. }
  \item{ emvMA }{ The smoothed (as specified by \code{ma}) ease of movement values. }

\note{
  A buy/sell signal is generated when the EMV crosses above/below zero.  When the EMV
  hovers around zero, there are small price movements and/or high volume, and the
  price is not moving easily.
