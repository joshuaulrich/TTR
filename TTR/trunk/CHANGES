TTR version 0.14-0 - not released
  Changes from version 0.13-2

- Removed 'message' function from CCI.R, VHF.R, WPR.R, aroon.R
  bollingerBands.R, and stochastic.R.

- Added Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) function and documentation.

- Change \sQuote{x} to 'x' in documentation.

- Added EMA Fortran implementation and NA checking/handling and
  added 'ratio' argument with default = NULL.

- Set na=NA for 'momentum' and 'ROC' functions in files KST.R
  RSI.R and TDI.R

- Added copyright information at the top of each file (.R and .f).

- Included Fortran implementations of SMA, EMA, WMA, EVWMA, ZLEMA.

- Changed all usage of 'rollFun' to their respective Fortran
  implementations and removed the 'rollFun' function.  Added functions
  are 'runSum', 'wilderSum', 'runMin', 'runMax', 'runSumProd', 'runVar'.

- Replaced R-based 'wilderSum' function with Fortran implementation.

- Made the below changes to the 'ZLEMA' function:
   - Add ratio argument with default = NULL.
   - Non-integer lags are a weighted mean of the two nearest
     observations, based on thier proximity to the lag value.
   - Change 'lag = ratio^(-1)' to fully support 'ratio' argument.

- Corrected EVWMA to start at period 'n' instead of 'n-1'.

- Changed the 'bollingerBands' function's 'sd' argument from a list
  that allows other dispersion functions to simply indicate the
  number of standard deviations to use.

- Changed 'bollingerBands' %B output value from 'pct.b' to 'pctB'.

- Changed 'WPR' output value from 'pct.R' to 'pctR'.

- Changed 'WPR' MA output value from 'ma.emv' to 'emvMA'.

- Changed 'aroon' output values from 'aroon.xx' to 'aroonXx'.

- Removed runSP/runSumProd function, since runSum(x*x) does the
  same thing as runSumProd(x,x).

- Added "implicit none" to every Fortran subroutine.

- Removed all DOS EOL characters via 'vim +"argdo set ff=unix" +wqa *'

- Changed documentation so "Usage", "Examples" section are a max of
  ~65-70 characters wide; it now prints better in plain text help.

- Removed 'oscillator' function and transferred functionality
  to 'MACD' function.

- Removed remnants of 'oscillator' function.

- Removed chaikinOscillator, since it can be created via
  MACD( chaikinAD ).

- Renamed 'chaikinMF' to 'CMF'.

- Renamed 'stochastic' to 'stoch'.

- Added 'williamsAD' function and documentation.

- Added Fortran-based routines, 'runMedian' and 'runMAD', with their R
  functions and documentation.

- Changed 'CCI' to use 'runMAD'.

- Added Fortran PSAR routine.
