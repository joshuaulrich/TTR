\usage{
  KST(price, n = c(10, 10, 10, 15),
    nROC = c(10, 15, 20, 30), nSig = 9, maType,
    wts = 1:NROW(n), ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{price}{Price series that is coercible to xts or
  matrix.}

  \item{n}{A vector of the number of periods to use in the
  MA calculations.}

  \item{nROC}{A vector of the number of periods to use in
  the ROC calculations.}

  \item{nSig}{The number of periods to use for the KST
  signal line.}

  \item{maType}{Either: \enumerate{ \item A function or a
  string naming the function to be called.  \item A
  \emph{list} with the first component like (1) above, and
  additional parameters specified as \emph{named}
  components.  See Examples. }}

  \item{wts}{A vector the same length as \code{n}, of the
  weight for each period (need not sum to one).}

  \item{\dots}{Other arguments to be passed to the
  \code{maType} function in case (1) above.}
}
\value{
  A object of the same class as \code{price} or a vector
  (if \code{try.xts} fails) containing the Know Sure Thing
  values.
}
\description{
  The Know Sure Thing (KST) is a smooth, summed, rate of
  change indicator. Developed by Martin Pring.
}
\details{
  For each day (week, month, etc.), the KST calculates the
  ROC over several periods.  Those ROCs are smoothed using
  the given moving averages, then multiplied by their
  respective weighting values.  The resulting values are
  summed for each day (month, week, etc.).
}
\note{
  The KST indicates bullish/bearish momentum as it crosses
  above/below its moving average.  Because the KST tends to
  lead price action, look for trend confirmation in the
  price.

  The default arguments are for the daily KST.  There is
  also the Long-Term KST, with arguments: \code{n=c(9, 12,
  18, 24)} - where the periods are months, not days - and
  the moving average periods are 6, 6, 6, and 9 months,
  respectively.
}
\examples{
data(ttrc)
kst <- KST(ttrc[,"Close"])

kst4MA <- KST(ttrc[,"Close"],
  maType=list(list(SMA),list(EMA),list(DEMA),list(WMA)))
