#'Aroon
#'
#'The Aroon indicator attempts to identify starting trends.  The indicator
#'consists of up and down lines, which measure how long it has been since the
#'highest high/lowest low has occurred in the last \code{n} periods.  Developed
#'by Tushar Chande in 1995.
#'
#'Aroon up (down) is the elapsed time, expressed as a percentage, between today
#'and the highest (lowest) price in the last \code{n} periods.  If today's
#'price is a new high (low) Aroon up (down) will be 100. Each subsequent period
#'without another new high (low) causes Aroon up (down) to decrease by (1 /
#'\code{n}) x 100.
#'
#'@param HL Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains either a
#'High-Low price series, or a Close price series.
#'@param n Number of periods to use in the calculation.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{HL} or a matrix (if
#'\code{try.xts} fails) containing the columns:
#' \describe{
#'  \item{ aroonUp }{ The Aroon up indicator. }
#'  \item{ aroonDn }{ The Aroon down indicator. }
#'  \item{ oscillator }{ The Aroon oscillator (\code{aroonUp - aroonDn}). }
#' }
#'@note If High-Low prices are given, the function calculates the max/min using
#'the high/low prices.  Otherwise the function calculates the max/min of the
#'single series.
#'
#'Up (down) trends are indicated when the aroonUp(Dn) is between 70 and 100.
#'Strong trends are indicated when when the aroonUp(Dn) is above 70 while the
#'aroonDn(Up) is below 30.  Also, crossovers may be useful.
