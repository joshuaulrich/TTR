  CLV(HLC)
}
\arguments{
  \item{HLC}{Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and
  contains High-Low-Close prices.}
}

  \code{try.xts} fails) containing the Close Location
  Values of a High-Low-Close price series.
}
\description{
  The Close Location Value (CLV) relates the day's close to
  its trading range.
}
\details{
  The CLV will fall in a range of -1 to +1.  If the CLV is
  +/-1, the close is at the high/low; if the CLV is 0, the
  close is directly between the high and low.
